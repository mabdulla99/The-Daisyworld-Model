## The Daisyworld Model
I created this code as part of a final project for the class Dynamical Climate (GEPH 220) that I took in Winter 2019 at Bates College. The project featured a classic rendition of the Daisyworld Model as proposed by environmentalist James Lovelock. Additionally, a function for introducing plagues was independently conceived and applied to determine how simulations would differ.A paper for further reading on results can be downloaded through this repository.

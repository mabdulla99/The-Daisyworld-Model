## The Daisyworld Model
I created this code as part of a final project for Dynamical Climate (GEPH 220) that I took in Winter 2019 at Bates College. The project featured a classic rendition with NumPy and Matplotlib of the Daisyworld Model as proposed by environmentalist James Lovelock. Additionally, a simple function for introducing plagues in the world was independently conceived, applied, and then results analyzed. A paper for further reading is also provided.
